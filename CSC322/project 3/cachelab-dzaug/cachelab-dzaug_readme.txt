Special Instructions for compiling the program:
It uses the strcasecmp function which is a POSIX, in the strings.h/string.h header file, which is not always available on windows depending on your compiler/IDE, so be warned.
Special Instructions for running the program:
In order for it to run you must specify lru in r field of the program in the command line.
Note:
I have also include my bash script files that I used to run the program in clion

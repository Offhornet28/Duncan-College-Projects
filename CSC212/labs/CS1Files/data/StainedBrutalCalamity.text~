No more holding back
They'll wish for demise
They thought they were invincible
But you could see through their hollow lies

You've seen how far they've come
How many they've slain
You will gladly tear their limbs apart
All before they start to kill again

They were seen as a threat
By the moment the dragon was killed by their hand
Now you're sent to demolish the foe
Upon your ruler's despondent demand

Something tells you they have scaled in their power
Should they win, it shall be your final hour
But you still have control of the fight
If they mess up, you might have a chance to destroy them

But is this the right path that you've taken?
Are your morals correct, or mistaken?
Are you sure you want to lose your mind
From a legend whose power could salvage mankind?
